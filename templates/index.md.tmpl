# {{.RenderedProviderName}} Provider

The [IndyKite](https://www.indykite.com/) provider allows you to interact with IndyKite API through Terraform files.

The provider need to be set and configured with one of the following environment variable:

- `INDYKITE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS_FILE` with path to service account credentials file generated from our console.
- `INDYKITE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` with content of service account credentials file generated from our console.

{{ if .HasExample -}}
## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
{{- end }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

Provider for now does not have schema and all is set within service account credential file.
