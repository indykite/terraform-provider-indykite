# indykite_application_agent (Resource)

Application agents are the profiles that contain the credentials used by applications to connect to the backend.  They represent the apps you develop or support, and need to integrate.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example - basic application agent (still valid)
resource "indykite_application_agent" "agent" {
  application_id = "ApplicationGID"
  name           = "terraform-agent"
  display_name   = "Terraform agent"
  description    = "Agent for terraform configuration"
}

# Example 1: Minimal configuration with hardcoded application_id
resource "indykite_application_agent" "minimal_agent" {
  application_id = "gid:AAAABGluZHlraURlgAACDwAAAAA"
  name           = "minimal-agent"
}

# Example 2: Full configuration with all optional fields
resource "indykite_application_agent" "full_agent" {
  application_id      = "gid:AAAABGluZHlraURlgAACDwAAAAA"
  name                = "full-agent"
  display_name        = "Full Agent"
  description         = "Agent with all optional fields"
  api_permissions     = ["Authorization", "Capture"]
  deletion_protection = false
}

# Example 3: Agent with reference to application resource
resource "indykite_application_agent" "agent_from_app" {
  application_id  = indykite_application.my_application.id
  name            = "agent-from-app"
  display_name    = "Agent from Application"
  description     = "Agent created from application reference"
  api_permissions = ["Authorization", "Capture", "EntityMatching"]
}

# Example 4: Agent with multiple API permissions
resource "indykite_application_agent" "agent_multi_permissions" {
  application_id  = indykite_application.my_application.id
  name            = "agent-multi-permissions"
  display_name    = "Agent with Multiple Permissions"
  description     = "Agent with all available API permissions"
  api_permissions = ["Authorization", "Capture", "EntityMatching", "IKGRead"]
}

# Example 5: Agent with deletion protection enabled
resource "indykite_application_agent" "protected_agent" {
  application_id      = indykite_application.my_application.id
  name                = "protected-agent"
  display_name        = "Protected Agent"
  description         = "Agent with deletion protection enabled"
  api_permissions     = ["Authorization"]
  deletion_protection = true
}


# These are automatically set when the agent is created, regardless of whether the
# Both fields can be referenced in outputs:
#
# }
#
# output "agent_app_space_id" {
#   value = indykite_application_agent.agent.app_space_id
# }
#
# output "agent_customer_id" {
#   value = indykite_application_agent.agent.customer_id
# }
```

### Read-Only

- `app_space_id` (String) Identifier of Application Space
- `create_time` (String) Timestamp when the Resource was created. Assigned by the server. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds. Example: "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".
