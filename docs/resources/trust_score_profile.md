  The Trust Score Profile helps assess how trustworthy data is. It allows applications, authorization policies, and AI systems to define and check  whether data meets specific reliability requirements. By validating key factors — such as how recent, complete, and accurate the data is —  the Trust Score ensures that only high-quality and reliable data is used in decision-making. This reduces risk and improves the overall quality of downstream processes.

# indykite_trust_score_profile (Resource)

The Trust Score Profile helps assess how trustworthy data is. It allows applications, authorization policies, and AI systems to define and check  whether data meets specific reliability requirements. By validating key factors — such as how recent, complete, and accurate the data is —  the Trust Score ensures that only high-quality and reliable data is used in decision-making. This reduces risk and improves the overall quality of downstream processes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example - trust score for Person

    weight = 0.3
  }
  schedule = "UPDATE_FREQUENCY_DAILY"
}

# Note: The location parameter accepts an Application Space ID.
# node_classification specifies the type of nodes this profile applies to.
# dimension weights must sum to 1.0 across all dimensions.
# schedule options: UPDATE_FREQUENCY_HOURLY, UPDATE_FREQUENCY_SIX_HOURS, UPDATE_FREQUENCY_DAILY
# The profile will automatically populate app_space_id and customer_id as computed fields.

- `node_classification` (String) NodeClassification is a node label in PascalCase, cannot be modified once set.
- `schedule` (String) Schedule sets the time between re-calculations. Possible values are: `UPDATE_FREQUENCY_DAILY`, `UPDATE_FREQUENCY_INVALID`, `UPDATE_FREQUENCY_SIX_HOURS`, `UPDATE_FREQUENCY_THREE_HOURS`, `UPDATE_FREQUENCY_TWELVE_HOURS`.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Your own description of the resource. Must be less than or equal to 65000 UTF-8 bytes.
- `display_name` (String) The display name for the instance. Can be updated without creating a new resource.

### Read-Only

- `app_space_id` (String) Identifier of Application Space
- `create_time` (String) Timestamp when the Resource was created. Assigned by the server. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds. Example: "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

### Nested Schema for `dimension`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the trust score dimensions. Possible values are: `NAME_COMPLETENESS`, `NAME_FRESHNESS`, `NAME_ORIGIN`, `NAME_VALIDITY`, `NAME_VERIFICATION`.  `Origin`: Identifies where the data comes from, ensuring its source is transparent and trustworthy.  `Validity`: Checks whether the data is in the correct format and follows expected rules.  `Completeness`: Confirms that no critical information is missing from the data.  `Freshness`: Measures how up-to-date the data is to ensure it's still relevant.  `Verification`: Ensures the data has been reviewed and confirmed as accurate by a trusted source.
