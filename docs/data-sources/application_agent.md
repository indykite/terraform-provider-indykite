# indykite_application_agent (Data Source)

Application agents are the profiles that contain the credentials used by applications to connect to the backend.  They represent the apps you develop or support, and need to integrate.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example - all parameters shown (still valid)
data "indykite_application_agent" "application_agent" {
  app_space_id = "ApplicationSpaceGID"
  name         = "AppAgentName"
}

# Example 2: Read application agent by app_agent_id only
data "indykite_application_agent" "agent_by_app_agent_id" {
  app_agent_id = "gid:AAAABWluZHlraURlgAADDwAAAAA"
}

# Example 3: Read application agent by name with reference to application_space
data "indykite_application_agent" "agent_by_name_ref" {
  app_space_id = indykite_application_space.my_space.id
  name         = "my-agent"
}

# Example outputs:
#
# output "agent_app_space_id" {
#   value = data.indykite_application_agent.agent_by_id.app_space_id
# }
#
# output "agent_api_permissions" {
#   value = data.indykite_application_agent.agent_by_id.api_permissions
# }
```
